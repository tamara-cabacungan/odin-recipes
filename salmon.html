    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>4 large cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pound side of salmon</li>
        <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>cracked pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>lemon slices to serve</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Line a baking tray or sheet with a large piece of foil, big enough to fold over and seal to create a packet of the salmon.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low-medium heat.</li> 
        <li>Add the honey, garlic, and lemon, and whisk until the honey has melted through the butter and the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Place salmon onto lined baking tray or sheet.</li>
        <li>Pour the butter-honey mixture over the salmon, and using a pastry brush or spoon, spread evenly over the salmon. Sprinkle a good amount of salt and cracked pepper.</li> 
        <li>Fold the sides of the foil over the salmon to cover and completely seal the packet closed so the butter does not leak.</li>
        <li>Bake until cooked through, about 15-18 minutes, depending on the thcikness of fish and preference of doneness.</li>
        <li>Open the foil, being careful of any escaping steam, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately with lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
