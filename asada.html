    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs flank steak</li>
        <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 limes, juiced -- about 6 tablespoons juice/li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
     
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk all of the oil, lime juice, garlic, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the steak to a glass or non-reactive baking tray and pour the marinade on top. Ensure both side of the steak are well coasted, cover the baking tray with plastic wrap and marinate for 1 to 4 hours. Alternatively, you could marinate in a plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill on medium-high heat. Add the carne asada and cook for 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for another 5 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the carne asada at an angle against the grain. From there, you can further chop the carne asada into smaller pieces, if you'd like.</li>
